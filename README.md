This OBS Studio plugin expands upon the built-in Replay Buffer, allowing users to save recent footage at different lengths with customizable save buttons, similar to how PlayStation/Xbox's "Save Recent Gameplay" functionality.

**Note:** Windows builds are 64-bit only, as OBS Studio 29.0.0+ dropped 32-bit support. macOS builds are universal binaries (arm64 + x86_64).

## How It Works
OBS keeps a rolling buffer of the last few seconds or minutes of footage in memory using the built-in replay buffer. The length of this footage is defined in settings. If the amount of footage exceeds the length in settings, old footage is overwritten as new footage is recorded.

Unlike the default Replay Buffer, which saves a fixed duration, this OBS Studio plugin allows users to save different lengths on demand. Set the replay buffer length, then clip custom lengths of footage automatically. Example: Set your replay buffer to 10 minutes. Save the last 30 seconds, 2 minutes, or 5 minutes instantly with UI buttons or hotkeys.

The project website is currently hosted via GitHub Pages.

## Usage

### Saving Clips
1. Start the Replay Buffer in OBS
2. Click any save clip button (customizable durations) or use the assigned hotkey
3. Use the Customize button to set your preferred clip lengths
4. The plugin will:
   - Save the full replay buffer
   - Automatically trim to the selected duration (Without re-encoding)
   - Replace the original file with the trimmed version

### Buffer Length
- Quickly adjust built-in replay buffer length (1s to 6h) without digging through the settings

### Hotkeys
- Assign hotkeys to each save duration button in OBS Settings > Hotkeys

### WebSocket command
Authenticated OBS WebSocket clients can save an arbitrary whole-second duration
with `CallVendorRequest`: vendor `replay-buffer-pro`, request `SaveClip`, data
`{"durationSeconds": 120}`. This uses the same save-and-trim path as the buttons.
Durations must be 1–21600 seconds and fit within the configured buffer length.
The vendor result (`responseData.responseData`) is `{"accepted": true}` or
`{"accepted": false, "error": "<reason>"}`, where the reason is `invalid-duration`,
`buffer-inactive`, `exceeds-buffer-length`, `save-refused` (for example, recording
is paused) or `unavailable` (OBS is shutting down). Acceptance is not file
completion; existing coalescing and deferred-save behavior still applies.

## Installation

### From Release

**Windows:**
1. Download the latest `.zip` release
2. Extract the ZIP file
3. Copy the `replay-buffer-pro` folder to `%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\obs-studio\plugins\` (typically `C:\ProgramData\obs-studio\plugins\`)

Final file structure should look like this:
```
obs-studio/
└── plugins/
    └── replay-buffer-pro/
        ├── bin/
        │   └── 64bit/
        │       └── replay-buffer-pro.dll
        └── data/
            └── locale/
                └── en-US.ini
```

**Note:** The `%ALLUSERSPROFILE%` environment variable typically resolves to `C:\ProgramData`. You can type this directly into File Explorer's address bar.

**macOS:**
1. Download the latest `.pkg` release (universal: arm64 + x86_64)
2. Open the downloaded `.pkg` and follow the installer
3. The installer places the plugin at `~/Library/Application Support/obs-studio/plugins/replay-buffer-pro.plugin` automatically

**Note:** If macOS blocks the installer because it's from an unidentified developer, right-click (or Control-click) the `.pkg` and choose **Open**, then confirm in the dialog.

## Building from Source

The build system follows the [obs-plugintemplate](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-plugintemplate) pattern. All dependencies (OBS Studio source, prebuilt obs-deps, Qt6) are **automatically downloaded** at configure time.

### Requirements

**Windows:**
- Windows 10/11 64-bit
- Visual Studio 2022+ with "Desktop development with C++"
- CMake 3.28+

**macOS:**
- macOS 13.0+ (builds target macOS 13.0+; universal binary: arm64 + x86_64)
- Xcode 26.5+ with macOS SDK 26.5+
- CMake 3.28+

No manual OBS clone, Qt6 install, or FFmpeg setup is needed on either platform — everything is fetched automatically.

### Build (Windows)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joshuapotter/replay-buffer-pro.git
cd replay-buffer-pro

# Configure (first run downloads deps and builds OBS — takes a few minutes)
cmake --preset windows-x64

# Build the plugin
cmake --build --preset windows-x64

# Install (close OBS first)
cmake --install build_x64 --config RelWithDebInfo
```

The install target places the plugin in `%ALLUSERSPROFILE%/obs-studio/plugins/`. After building, a rundir is also available at `build_x64/rundir/RelWithDebInfo/` for quick testing.

### Build (macOS)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joshuapotter/replay-buffer-pro.git
cd replay-buffer-pro

# Configure (first run downloads deps and builds OBS — takes a few minutes)
cmake --preset macos

# Build the plugin (universal binary)
cmake --build --preset macos

# Install (close OBS first)
cmake --install build_macos --config RelWithDebInfo
```

The install target places the `.plugin` bundle in `~/Library/Application Support/obs-studio/plugins/`. After building, a rundir is also available at `build_macos/rundir/RelWithDebInfo/` for quick testing.

### Release (Windows)

Update the version in `buildspec.json`, then run:
```bash
cmake --preset windows-x64
cmake --build build_x64 --config RelWithDebInfo --target prepare_release
```
This creates `build_x64/releases/<version>/replay-buffer-pro-windows-x64.zip`.

### Release (macOS)

There is no local one-command release target for macOS. Packaging (codesigning, notarization, and `.pkg` creation via `.github/scripts/package-macos`) requires CI credentials and only runs in GitHub Actions — see CI / GitHub Actions below.

### CI / GitHub Actions

Pushing a semver tag (e.g., `1.4.0`) to `main`/`master` triggers the GitHub Actions workflow, which builds the plugin for both Windows and macOS and creates a draft GitHub release with all artifacts attached (Windows `.zip` and macOS `.pkg`).

## Troubleshooting

- Verify plugin file location (`.dll` on Windows, `.plugin` bundle on macOS)
- Check OBS logs for errors

### A clip wasn't trimmed

Every replay save writes one `TRIM VERDICT` line to the OBS log (**Help → Log Files → Show Log Files**). Search the log for `TRIM VERDICT` and find the line matching the clip:

- `skipped reason=no-pending-request` — the save was triggered outside this plugin, so it was saved at full buffer length. OBS's own **Save Replay** hotkey, the tray menu item, and Stream Deck buttons using the official *OBS Studio* plugin's "Save Replay Buffer" action all take this path. Use one of Replay Buffer Pro's own **Save Clip** hotkeys (Settings → Hotkeys → *Replay Buffer Pro: Save ...*) so the plugin knows which duration you wanted.
- `skipped reason=save-full-buffer` — this was a **Save Replay Buffer** click, which is intentionally untrimmed.
- `skipped reason=encoder-paused` — recording was paused when you pressed save. OBS doesn't save the replay buffer while recording is paused, so nothing was saved. Resume recording and press save again.
- `skipped reason=replay-buffer-stopped` — the replay buffer was stopped before OBS started writing the clip.

If you press a save hotkey while OBS is still writing a previous clip, the new save waits for that write to finish, then is trimmed back so it ends at the moment you pressed the key. That clip's verdict line shows `end_offset=`, how long it waited (not counting time recording was paused). On slow storage such as a network drive, where writing a long buffer can take minutes, a short replay buffer may no longer hold everything before your press: the clip still ends at the press but is shorter, or, if the buffer holds nothing from before the press, the trim fails with `window-not-in-buffer` and the full-length file is kept. A **Save Replay Buffer** click is never trimmed, so if it has to wait, it contains the buffer as of when it was written, not when you clicked.
- `failed reason=output-too-long` — your encoder's keyframe interval is too long for the clip length you asked for, so the cut could not land near the right place. Set **Settings → Output → Keyframe Interval** to 2 seconds.
- `failed reason=window-not-in-buffer` — the save had to wait for a previous clip to finish writing, and by then your replay buffer no longer held anything from before you pressed the key. The full-length file is kept. Increase the replay buffer length, or save to faster storage.
- `failed reason=open-input-failed` — something else was holding the file. If **Settings → Advanced → Automatically remux to mp4** is enabled, try turning it off; antivirus and cloud-sync folders can do the same.
- Any other `failed reason=...` — check disk space and write permissions in the output directory, and include the line when reporting an issue.

A failed trim always leaves your original full-length clip in place, so nothing is lost.
- When building from source:
  - **Windows**: Ensure Visual Studio 2022+ and CMake 3.28+ are installed
  - **macOS**: Ensure Xcode 26.5+ (with macOS SDK 26.5+) and CMake 3.28+ are installed; run `xcode-select --install` if needed
  - First configure run downloads ~500MB of dependencies — ensure network access
  - **Windows**: Run install command in a terminal with admin privileges if installing to a protected directory

## Third-Party Software

This plugin uses OBS Studio's built-in FFmpeg libraries (libavformat) for video trimming functionality. FFmpeg is licensed under the LGPL v2.1+ license.

Because the plugin links against OBS's bundled FFmpeg libraries by soname, each release is built against a specific OBS version's FFmpeg major version and is not binary-compatible with OBS versions that ship a different FFmpeg major. Always use the plugin release matching your OBS Studio version's minimum requirement.
